zoomdata-css
============

Zoomdata's CSS Framework - This project is meant to be a framework for commonly used UI elements in the Zoomdata interface.
The code is written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), built using [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com/) and commented using [KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss/). [Inuit.css](https://github.com/inuitcss) was also minimally used as a starting point with custom objects imported after that in the `main.scss` file. Custom Zoomdata Symbol fonts are included in the fonts directory.

## Getting Started
* clone the repo and cd to the created directory
* run `npm install` to install all grunt plugin dependencies
* run `grunt` to build the [KSS](http://warpspire.com/kss/) documentation and watch for changes
